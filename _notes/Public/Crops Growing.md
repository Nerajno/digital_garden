# My Developer Journey

Welcome to my digital garden using Obsidian and Jekyll garden theme, how [its done or other resources ](/_posts/2020-03-01-how-to.md). Its job is to be documentation of the junior front end developer to a more experienced technical consultant and professional. Here I track my learning progress, ongoing projects, and accumulated knowledge as I grow my skills and expertise.
